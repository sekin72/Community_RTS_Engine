# Community_RTS_Engine

Real time strategy games (henceforth referred to as RTS) are a very popular genre of video games with the ability to
control, construct, create and interact with various units, buildings and terrains. As such subgenres of RTS have evolved
over time. We, as a group have decided to serve various subgenres of RTS games and create an engine capable of
producing differing types of RTS games seeing as many have a huge set in common across many platforms.

With the aforementioned in mind, we have opted to create a real time strategy game engine that allows us to create at
least 3 different types of RTS games, appealing to different consumers with different interests and needs. Building on a
core engine which provides the core graphical assets, animations, movement and interaction mechanics, static maps and
aesthetic style, we designed three games as follows; Commander, Kingdom Builder &amp; Spells and Battlefields.

Commander is a classical competitive RTS and draws inspirations from classic games like Age of Empires, Red Alert,
Warcraft, Starcraft etc. Kingdom Builder is a sandbox simulation game which is aimed at noncompetitive players who opt
for more slow paced simulation games and it draws heavily from Settlers and Anno series of games, Finally Spells and
Battlefields is the fast paced version that revolves around 1 vs 1 fight on a single map. This game target players that like
to play short matches and that are more likely to use mobile gaming platforms and is similar to games like Clash Royale.
